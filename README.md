## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

# Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies

## Overview

### Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.

### Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to project management and software development. It emphasizes thorough planning and a structured progression through distinct phases.

## Comparison

### Flexibility
- **Agile**: Highly flexible, allowing changes at any stage of the project.
- **Waterfall**: Inflexible, with changes being difficult and costly once the project is underway.

### Project Phases
- **Agile**: Divides the project into small, manageable iterations or sprints.
- **Waterfall**: Divides the project into distinct phases such as requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

### Customer Involvement
- **Agile**: High level of customer involvement throughout the project.
- **Waterfall**: Customer involvement is typically limited to the requirements phase and final delivery.

### Documentation
- **Agile**: Focuses on working software over comprehensive documentation.
- **Waterfall**: Emphasizes detailed documentation at each phase.

### Risk Management
- **Agile**: Risks are identified and mitigated early through continuous feedback and iterations.
- **Waterfall**: Risks are identified and addressed at the end of each phase, which can lead to late discovery of issues.

## Advantages

### Agile
- **Flexibility**: Easily adapts to changes in project scope and requirements.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Continuous delivery of valuable software ensures customer satisfaction.
- **Early Detection of Issues**: Frequent testing and feedback help identify and resolve issues early.

### Waterfall
- **Clear Structure**: Well-defined stages and milestones provide a clear project structure.
- **Predictability**: Detailed planning and documentation make it easier to predict project timelines and costs.
- **Ease of Management**: The linear approach simplifies project management and tracking.

## Disadvantages

### Agile
- **Unclear Final Costs**: Flexibility can lead to unclear final costs and timelines.
- **Requires Skilled Team**: Success depends on a highly skilled and self-organizing team.
- **Potential for Scope Creep**: Continuous changes can lead to scope creep if not managed properly.

### Waterfall
- **Inflexibility**: Difficult to accommodate changes once the project is underway.
- **Late Testing**: Testing occurs late in the development cycle, which can lead to late discovery of critical issues.
- **Limited Customer Feedback**: Minimal customer involvement after the requirements phase can result in a final product that does not meet customer needs.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
